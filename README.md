# Dice Game ðŸŽ²

## Introduction
The Dice Game is a simple program that simulates a dice roll between the user and the computer. Each roll generates two random numbers, one representing the user's dice and the other the computer's dice. The outcome of the game is determined based on the comparison of these numbers:

- **Win**: The user's number is greater than the computer's number.  
- **Draw**: Both numbers are equal.  
- **Loss**: The computer's number is greater than the user's number.

This game is an excellent introduction to random number generation and basic game logic in programming.

## Features
- Generates two random dice rolls (one for the user and one for the computer).
- Provides clear feedback for win, draw, or loss.
- Simple and intuitive logic, ideal for beginners to understand basic programming concepts.

---

## How It Works
1. The program uses a random number generator to simulate a dice roll for both the user and the computer.
2. The two numbers are compared to determine the outcome.
3. The result is displayed to the user.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (for running the program).
